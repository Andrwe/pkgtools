newpkg:3:#TODO: Use ACTIONS=() as in pkgfile
newpkg:4:#TODO: Add --abs
newpkg:5:#TODO: Perhaps an --append option, to add files to an existing dir. Currently you can do it but it's clunky
newpkg:19:ACTIONS=()       # Better than $DOFOO TODO
newpkg:23:DOABS=0          # Copy from ABS instead of normal operation TODO

# ----

We should hack up some sort of release script also.
makepkg || die
namcamp PKGBUILD pkgtools*.pkg.tar.gz || die
find pkg -type f
find src -type f
yesno "look good"? || die
git commit -a -s -m "Release: $releasever" -e
git tag "$releasever"
git push; git push --tags

Autodetect releasever or CLI option?

# ----

Path to functions file is hardcoded to /usr, what about people using /usr/local?
maybe I need a makefile for this...

# ----

Use $BUILDSCRIPT from makepkg.conf instead of hardcoding "PKGBUILD"

# ----

Include ideas from http://threadstates.com/downloads/pac-file

# ----

pkgfile: Implement pkgquery like rpm -Qf.
	 Partially done. Local files work, but should also be able to search the filelist
